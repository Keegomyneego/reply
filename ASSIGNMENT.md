# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I walked through the code one bit at a time and tried to understand what each piece did. I would find a block of code, look up any functions called and get a general feel for what they did (a slightly recursive process), and then use that to reason what the block of code did. I did that for each block of code until I understood most of the library. Function names ended up being super helpful most of the time as they we're pretty well named and acted as a reference to each glob of understanding that I developed. There were a lot of ninja-esque solutions and usage of shorthand that did make the code concise, but often harder to read and reason about.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Comments should give an overview of what's going on. They shouldn't change much if at all when the implementation of the function changes. It's the end result(s) of calling the function. 


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Roughly 8-10. Need to be faster while still maintaining quality....


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Aint nobody got time for that.


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Spent a lot of time trying to find a good node package to work with. Ended up just using one of the suggested ones. Should've done that from the start. Maybe next time just preselect about 10/15 packages and have us select one. I know that's more work for you but it makes things a lot less frustrating. Thanks :)
